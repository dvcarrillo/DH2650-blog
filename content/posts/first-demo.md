It has been an active week regarding the development of the game! All teams have been working hard in order to have ready for yesterday, April 16th, an amazing first demo of what will be their game, showing the core concepts and mechanics of them. Of course, time has been extremely limited and the demos were relatively basic, but I was amazed of the work many teams have done in such little time.

On our side, and as we are working on a 3D game, we need even more time and resources. Something I have learnt is that it is very important to find as many *premade* assets as possible if you are short in time. While two mates from our team have been mostly focused on C# development, I have been trying to build the 3D scene for the first level, although I try to be up to date with the code that is being written as well.

### "Unity, what else?"
The process of building the 3D scene, which is basically creating an apartment and its exterior, has been mostly done directly in Unity. I think that doing it fully in Unity is actually a pain in the neck, as it does not really help with positioning elements and showing several perspectives at the same time. My take is that, next time, I should use a proper 3D modeling software and then export it to Unity.

### Our working demo

So, with this and the incredible work from the rest of the team, our demo was ready! We focused on showing the functionality of swapping between characters (human and frog â€“ which includes different modes, even a split screen mode for local multiplayer!) and on showing the 3D models of them.

More exciting news soon!
