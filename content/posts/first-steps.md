One of the hardest parts in a project is to start with it. Specially if one is part of a group, which is chosen randomly, and which is asked to produce a game (or an extensive enough *demo*) in over two months. Well, this is where I was.

### Brainstorming
>Brainstorming is a method design teams use to generate ideas to solve clearly defined design problems. In controlled conditions and a free-thinking environment, teams approach a problem by such means as “How Might We” questions. They produce a vast array of ideas and draw links between them to find potential solutions.

This was logically the first task that we did to come up with a theme for the game. Normally, a team should come to an agreement after a brainstorming session, and (possibly) drop some ideas, while going forward with others. In this case, we just mixed all our output. And the result involved ninja frogs.

### The First Pitch
Shortly after, we needed to present this idea in a small presentation, where we would talk about the game idea, its selling points, a business plan scheme… This was all discussed along the several meetings we did before the pitch. Even though our game idea was completely absurd and random, I have to admit that the rest of the parts were really well planned and made total sense. In summary:
* The goal of the game is to **solve puzzles**.
* **Two main characters**: an office worker with the dullest of lives and a *[weeaboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanophilia)* frog. For some reason, they live together. 
* The differences between the two characters will create absurd situations that will be at the heart of the game.
* The target audience are the indie gamers.
* The target platform is Windows, with controller support so it can easily be ported later on to other platforms.
* It is a [buy-to-play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy-to-play) game.

### Logo design
My major commitment at this stage was to design the logo of the game. At this moment, I master the Sketch app, but I am just learning Adobe Illustrator. Therefore, this was a perfect opportunity to practice and to develop my skills. This was the end result:
