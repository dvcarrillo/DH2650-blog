# DH2650 - Game development journal

This repository contains the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) page a of my development journal for the subject *DH2650 Computer Game Design* at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, about the development of our videogame, "Hop To It!".

There is an action to build and publish the website on every commit to [dvcarrillo.com/dh2650-blog/](https://dvcarrillo.com/DH2650-blog/).
See the public page on the ```gh-pages``` branch.
