This is the first entry of my game dev journal, a blog that I will regularly update to keep track of my progress during the development of our project for the subject DH2650 Computer Game Design at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
What will you find here? I will focus on reflecting on my individual contributions, organization of the team and general updates of our project. The content will range from topics like programming to illustration, according to my work and needs of the team.</description></item></channel></rss>
