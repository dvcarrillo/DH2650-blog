In controlled conditions and a free-thinking environment, teams approach a problem by such means as “How Might We” questions. They produce a vast array of ideas and draw links between them to find potential solutions.</p><p>&ndash; Interaction Design Foundation</p></blockquote><p>This was logically the first task that we did to come up with a theme for the game. Normally, a team should come to an agreement after a brainstorming session, and (possibly) drop some ideas, while going forward with others. In this case, we just mixed all our output. And the result involved ninja frogs.</p><h3 id=the-first-pitch>The First Pitch</h3><p>Shortly after, we needed to present this idea in a small presentation, where we would talk about the game idea, its selling points, a business plan scheme… This was all discussed along the several meetings we did before the pitch. Even though our game idea was completely absurd and random, I have to admit that the rest of the parts were really well planned and made total sense. In summary:</p><ul><li>The goal of the game is to <strong>solve puzzles</strong>.</li><li><strong>Two main characters</strong>: an office worker with the dullest of lives and a <em><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanophilia>weeaboo</a></em> frog. For some reason, they live together.</li><li>The differences between the two characters will create absurd situations that will be at the heart of the game.</li><li>The target audience are the indie gamers.</li><li>The target platform is Windows, with controller support so it can easily be ported later on to other platforms.</li><li>It is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy-to-play>buy-to-play</a> game.</li></ul><h3 id=logo-design>Logo design</h3><p>My major commitment at this stage was to design the logo of the game. At this moment, I master the Sketch app, but I am just learning Adobe Illustrator. Therefore, this was a perfect opportunity to practice and to develop my skills. This was the end result:
